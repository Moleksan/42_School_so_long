This project is a small 2D game designed to help you understand and work with basic graphical elements like textures, sprites, and simple gameplay. It involves creating a game where you can interact with different map elements, display textures on screen, and manage movement within a window. Below, I'll describe how I approached this project and the resources that helped me.  
  
How I Developed the Project  
  
1. Understanding the Basics  
  
Before diving into the project, I started learning the essentials of working with textures and rendering a window. The guide I used for the initial setup and understanding can be found here. This resource gave me a foundation on how to:  
  
- Open a window using the MinilibX library.  
- Paint graphics inside the window.  
- Show textures on specific points of the screen, crucial for the game development.  

2. Setting up the Window and Graphics  
  
After understanding the basics, I followed the tutorial to configure and open a game window using the MinilibX library. The MinilibX documentation provided clear instructions on how to handle window creation and rendering, and I referred to Harm Smits' MinilibX guide frequently for technical details on window management, handling events, and rendering sprites.  

3. Working with Textures and Sprites  
  
To make the game visually interesting, I needed textures for my game. I used two key websites:  
  
- A page to find and create textures: Texture Page  
- A tool to convert .png files into .xpm format, which is required for MinilibX: Convertio  
  
These tools helped me prepare all the game assets, which I later loaded into the game using MinilibX functions.  
  
4. Map and Game Logic  
  
The next step was to implement the map system and game logic. This involved reading a .ber file for the map, defining the game grid, and then rendering textures based on the content of each grid cell (e.g., walls, characters, exits).  
  
5. Gameplay and Movement  
  
Once the map was set up, I worked on adding character movement within the game. This was where event handling in MinilibX came into play, allowing me to capture key presses and update the playerâ€™s position accordingly.  
  
### Tools and Resources  
  
- MinilibX: The graphical library used for opening windows and rendering images.  
  - MinilibX Documentation  
- Texture and Sprite Tools:  
  - Texture Library  
  - PNG to XPM Converter  
- Guides:  
  - Comprehensive Guide to So Long  

# Consulation  
  
This project helped me understand the basics of creating a game, like opening a window, showing textures, and handling player movement. Using the guides and tools, I was able to build a simple 2D game.
